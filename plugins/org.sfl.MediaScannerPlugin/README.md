DEPRECATION WARNING

This plugin is UNMAINTAINED and has not been updated since 2013. Please do not ask for help in the Issues section as I will not be able to help you!

MediaScannerPlugin
============

This plugin invokes the Media Scanner on Android OS to add media files to the device's Media Index. If you download an image or a video, you will need to use the Media Scanner to index it before it will show up in the Android Gallery. This plugin will allow you to do that.

Installation
------------

### For Cordova 3.0.x:

1. To add this plugin just type: `cordova plugin add https://github.com/peteygao/MediaScannerPlugin.git` or `phonegap local plugin add https://github.com/peteygao/MediaScannerPlugin.git`
2. To remove this plugin type: `cordova plugin remove org.sfl.MediaScannerPlugin` or `phonegap local plugin remove org.sfl.MediaScannerPlugin`


Usage:
------

Call the `window.MediaScannerPlugin(successCallback, failureCallback)` method by passing in your success and error callbacks:

### Example
```javascript
function onDeviceReady()
{
	window.MediaScannerPlugin.scanFile(
        function(msg){
            console.log(msg);
        },
        function(err){
            console.log(err);
        },
    );
}
```

The function will call your successCallback upon success, and failureCallback on failure.
